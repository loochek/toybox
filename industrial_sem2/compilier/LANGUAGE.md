*Hopefully, I have described my programming language enough*

## General language concepts

### Syntax
- Identifier
    - A string of uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits, and underscores that doesn't start with a digit
- Numeric literal
    - A sequence of digits representing a non-negative integer number
- Expression
    - The basic element of the language
    - Root expressions are numeric literals, identifiers or functions calls
        - A function call is an identifier with parentheses on the right, in which expressions can be listed, separated by commas
            - Examples:
                - foo()
                - bar(4, foobar)
        - Examples:
            - 5
            - var
            - foo(1, 2, 3, foobar)
    - Other expressions are created as a combination of two expressions linked by some operator
        - Examples:
            - 5 + 5
            - 5 / foo(1)
            - a = 5
    - Expression can be wrapped with parentheses
- Operator
    - Makes a new expression from one or two other expressions
    - Default operators: + - * / % == != < > <= >= =
    - Special operator = takes identifier as left argument
- Statement
    - There are several types of expressions:
        - Expression statement
            - Expression as statement
            - Syntax: expression;
                - Examples:
                    - a = 5;
                    - 5 + 4;
                    - fn(23,1231,132);
        - If statement:
            - Syntax: if (expression) statement
        - While statement
            - Syntax: while (expression) statement
        - Compound statement
            - Syntax: { statement1 statement2 ... }
            - combination of other statements
                - Example:
                    - { a = 5; gg(234); { a = 10; } }
        - Function declaration statement
            - Syntax: fn <name>(<params>) <compound stmt>
            - (where name is some identifier, params are empty or identifiers delimetered with comma)
                - Example:
                    - fn foo(a, b) { z = 10; }

        - Variable declaration statement:
            - Syntax: let x;
            - (or)
            - Syntax: let x = <expression>;
                - Examples:
                    - let a;
                    - let a = 10;
        - Return statement
            - Syntax: return;
            - (or)
            - Syntax: return <expr>;
            - Examples:
                - return;
                - return 123 + 12;

### Semantics

- The only data type is signed 64-bit integer
- Identifier
    - is a name of variable or function
- Numeric literal
    - returns its value as an expression
- Variable
    - is some memory cell
    - returns its value as an expression
    - is created as the result of variable declaration statement
    - a value of the variable can be set during declaration and updated by an assignment operator 
- Expression
    - Must have value as calculation result
- Operator
    - Takes return values of arguments and returns its value according to them
    - Operator = updates a value of the variable with return value of an expression.
    - Operator = returns value of the expression
    - Behaviour of other operators is intuitive, comparsions returns 0 or 1
    - Parentheses can be used in an expression to control order of calculations
    - Default order:
        - Parenthesed expression, function call, variable, numeric literal
        - * / %
        - + -
        - comparsions, assignment
        - (operators on the same level are calculated consistently)
        
    - Examples:
        - 5 + 2 - return value is 7
        - a = 5 - return value is 5, a value of the variable a has been updated
        - (5 + 3) * 2 - return value is 16

- Control flow
    - Program consists of function
        - A function is a statement to execute
            - Function must have return value
                - A return value is controlled by return statement, 0 by default
            - Function can have arguments
                - Arguments are variables with values predefined when called and can be used like regular variables
- Statement
    - Expression statement
        - Just omits its value
    - If statement:
        - Executes statement if the expression is not equals to 0
    - While statement
        - Executes statement while the expression is not equals to 0
    - Compound statement
        - A set of statements to execute
        - Statements are executed consistently
    - Function declaration statement
        - Declares a function
        - TODO: scope
    - Variable declaration statement
        - Declares a variable
        - TODO: scope
- At the beginning of execution, the function called 'main' is called
- Formal description of the semantics can be found in TODO
