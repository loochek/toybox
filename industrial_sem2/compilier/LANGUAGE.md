*Hopefully, I have described my programming language enough*

## General language concepts
### Syntax
- Identifier
    - A string of uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits, and underscores that doesn't start with a digit
- Numeric literal
    - A sequence of digits representing a non-negative integer number
- Expression
    - The basic element of the language
    - Root expressions are numeric literals, identifiers or functions calls
        - A function call is an identifier with parentheses on the right, in which expressions can be listed, separated by commas
            - Examples:
                - foo()
                - bar(4, foobar)
        - Identifiers can have an expression in square brackets on the right (_indexed identifiers_)
        - Examples:
            - 5
            - var
            - arr\[a + 1\]
            - foo(1, 2, 3, foobar)
    - Other expressions are created as a combination of two expressions linked by some operator
        - Examples:
            - 5 + 5
            - 5 / foo(1)
            - a = 5
    - Expression can be wrapped with parentheses
- Operator
    - Makes a new expression from one or two other expressions
    - Default operators: + - * / % == != \< \> \<= \>= =
    - Special operator = takes identifier or indexed identifier as left argument
- Statement
    - There are several types of expressions:
        - Expression statement
            - Expression as statement
            - Syntax: expression;
            - Examples:
                - a = 5;
                - 5 + 4;
                - fn(23,1231,132);
        - If statement:
            - Syntax: if (expression) statement
            - (or)
            - Syntax: if (expression) statement else statement
            - Examples:
                - if (a == 4) return 5;
                - if (a == 4) return 5; else return 6;
        - While statement
            - Syntax: while (expression) statement
            - Example:
                - while (a <= 4) a = a + 1;
        - Compound statement
            - Syntax: { statement1 statement2 ... }
            - combination of other statements
            - Example:
                - { a = 5; gg(234); { a = 10; } }
        - Function declaration statement
            - Syntax: fn \<name\>(\<params\>) \<compound stmt\>
            - (where name is some identifier, params are empty or identifiers delimetered with comma)
            - Example:
                - fn foo(a, b) { z = 10; }
        - Variable declaration statement:
            - Syntax: let x;
            - (or)
            - Syntax: let x = \<expression\>;
            - (or)
            - Syntax: let x\[number\];
            - Examples:
                - let a;
                - let a = 10;
                - let arr\[10\];
        - Return statement
            - Syntax: return;
            - (or)
            - Syntax: return \<expr\>;
            - Examples:
                - return;
                - return 123 + 12;

### Semantics
- The only data type is signed 64-bit integer
- Identifier
    - Is a name of variable or function
    - Indexed identifiers used with variables
- Numeric literal
    - Returns its value as an expression
- Variable
    - Identifier in terms of syntax
    - Is some memory cell
    - Returns its value as an expression
    - Is created as the result of variable declaration statement
    - A value of the variable can be set during declaration and updated by an assignment operator 
    - Must have value as calculation result
    - There are special variables called _arrays_ - a bunch of variables, which variable to access is determined by some expression
        - A specific variable is accessed through square brackets (indexed identifiers)
            - Usual variables can be also used with brackets, but it's considered as undefined behavior
        - Array variables can be accesed without brackets - as synonym to \[0\]
- Operator
    - Takes return values of arguments and returns its value according to them
    - Operator = updates a value of the variable with return value of an expression.
    - Operator = returns value of the expression
    - Behaviour of other operators is intuitive, comparsions returns 0 or 1
    - Parentheses can be used in an expression to control order of calculations
    - Default order:
        - Parenthesed expression, function call, variable, numeric literal
        - multiplication, division and modulo
        - addition and subtraction
        - comparsions, assignment
        - (operators on the same level are calculated consistently)
        
    - Examples:
        - 5 + 2 - return value is 7
        - a = 5 - return value is 5, a value of the variable a has been updated
        - (5 + 3) * 2 - return value is 16

- Control flow
    - Program consists of function
    - A function is a execution unit
    - Function must have return value
        - A return value is controlled by return statement, 0 by default
    - Function can have arguments
        - Arguments are variables with values predefined when called and can be used like regular variables
- Statement
    - Expression statement
        - Just omits its value
    - If statement:
        - Executes statement if the expression is not equals to 0
            - otherwise, an else statement is executed if present
    - While statement
        - Executes statement while the expression is not equals to 0
    - Compound statement
        - A set of statements to execute
        - Statements are executed consistently
    - Function declaration statement
        - Defines a function
    - Variable declaration statement
        - Declares a variable and, maybe, initializes it
        - (or)
        - Declares an array variable of given size
    - Return statement
        - Defines return point and value of a function
        
- Variable scopes
    - Are defined by compound statements, also function arguments are in their own scope
    - Variables in one scope must have different names
    - Variables in nested scopes can have the same name - in this case, the variable from the top scope is used
    - Variable is no longer accessible when out of its scope
    
- Function names
    - There are no any standarts - Tiny Compilier just uses the first occurence of a function definition due its symbol resolver logic
    
- At the beginning of execution, the function called 'main' is called

## Standart library
- fn input()
    - Asks user for a number from stdin
    - Understands minus and plus at the beginning
- fn print(x)
    - Prints number x to stdout
