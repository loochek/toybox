# TrackedInt

There is a tool that hooks operations with instances of a certain class that behaves like an integer. The result is a text and graphic log that represents the full lifecycle of objects - creation, copying, moving and destruction. To demonstrate the power of the tool, an analysis about move semantics is present.
